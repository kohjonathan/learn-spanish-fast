# MY SPANISH LEARNING JOURNEY
Back in 2002, i created a course that teaches techniques to *Learn to Read, Write and Speak Spanish Fast*. The techniques leverage on clever mind hacks. It's call [Good Spanish in 8 Weeks](#good-spanish-in-8-weeks) and was designed specifically for the Singaporean.

[SPANISH LESSONS FOR SINGAPOREANS](https://bridgesa.net/spanish-class.html)

**I STARTED AS A SINGAPOREAN WHO ONLY SPOKE ENGLISH AND MANDARIN**
<br />I learned Spanish back in 1994. It was for an overseas church-planting mission to Chile back then.
The journey started with a Mexican sister in a small classroom setting. With a lot of patience, the teacher taught us our first lessons week after week.
We did lots of verbal practices, sang Spanish worship songs, exchanged short greetings plus basic phrases. 

**WE MEMORISED SPANISH PHRASES AND PRACTICED CASUAL CONVERSATIONS WITH EACH OTHER**
<br />It seemed that language hacks didn't exist. Or back in those days, it wasn't a thing. I'm not sure.
It was slower but the traditional method did work.
Three months later, we were in Chile and the lessons continued daily with a missionary who had lived in Latin America for like 30 years already. The method was similar to that used by the Mexican teacher except that the focus was a bit different. We went beyond basic phrases.

**WE FOCUSED MORE ON SPANISH GRAMMAR WRITING**
<br />Yes, we did. I remember the sheets and sheets of printed lessons, the many tables that we had to fill in the conjugations, we read the Bible in Spanish and sang more in Spanish.
They were quite dry but guess what, they worked like a charm.
We actually started using the language more confidently on a daily basis.
I remember our teacher sending out on errands to practice our language.
Our teahcer eben got us acquainted with a local church community so we learned from them.

**THEN, WE LEARNED THE ACTUAL LANGUAGE ON THE STREETS**
<br />The moment came, weeks after the in-house training. We were sent two-by-two onto the streets to knock on doors and share the Good News to Chileans.
While we equipped with a good foundation, it didn't take us to long to realise that there were lots of stuff beyond what we know.
For instance, the locals didn't use properly constructed sentences. They abbreviated a lot of stuff. They spoke with gestures. They sentences werew usually short unless engaged in a debate.
Our language was taken to a whole new different level. It was built upon the foundations we had learned from the two teachers.

**WE STARTED EXPRESSING OUR INTENTIONS AND THOUGHTS IN SPANISH MORE FLUENTLY**
<br />After six months or so on the streets, we started conversing with confidence. We could express ourselves with lesser effort, explain biblical concepts, and essentially what we were doing in a place so far away from our home.
People were actually beginning to understand us a lot better. We made lots of friends on the streets, got invited to have meals, to events, etc. We started to make some friends. The team of four Singaporeans stayed for one twelve months before the mission ended. I opted to stay beyond the agreed voluntary period because i heard GOD telling me to do so. I made even more friends and had more practice with the Spanish language. I spoke no English as hardly anyone spoke English where I was.

**I NEVER STOPPED SPEAKING SPANISH SINCE**
<br />After my mission, language continued to be a part of me. And, with time, i decided I wanted to pass on my skills to others.
I started developing the course I mentioned above. In the process of which I began developing mind hacks and techniques which could shortcut the learning from one year to eight weeks. While the language schools in Singapore continued to teach language the traditional way, I taught it unconventionally and was getting results. It turns out that there were better ways for us Singaporeans to learn Spanish, there really is.

**CLEVER MIND HACKS FOR LANGUAGE LEARNING**
<br />I applied the hacks and techniques and kept tweaking them. My coursebook went through various revisions as the methodology got fine-tuned. It was a course that was helping Singaporeans speak, read and write Spanish in 8 weeks!*
